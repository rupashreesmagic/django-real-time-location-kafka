Real-Time Location Tracking with Google Maps and Apache Kafka

This project demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate Google Maps with Apache Kafka to enable real-time location tracking for a delivery boy. By leveraging Django, the backend system effectively consumes and produces latitude and longitude data, updating the Google Maps interface to provide live tracking of delivery activities.

Introduction

In this advanced project tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Kafka with Django, a crucial skill for mastering real-time data processing and web application development. This project is perfect for those who wish to enhance their Django skills through project-based learning. Whether you're looking to advance your backend development expertise or want to implement live tracking features, this project provides a comprehensive guide to achieving that goal.
Technologies Used

    Django: Backend web framework.
    Apache Kafka: Distributed event streaming platform.
    Google Maps API: For displaying real-time location tracking.
    Python: Programming language used throughout the project.
    JavaScript: For front-end integration with Google Maps.
    Docker: Containerization for easier deployment.
    PostgreSQL: Database used for storing user and location data.

Features

    Real-time location tracking of delivery personnel.
    Integration of Google Maps with Django backend.
    Kafka consumers and producers to handle location data streams.
    Scalable architecture using Kafka and Django.

Project Setup
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+
    Django 3.2+
    Apache Kafka
    Docker (optional, for containerization)
    Google Maps API Key

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/rupashreesmagic/django-real-time-location-kafka.git
cd real-time-location-tracking

Set up a virtual environment:

bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables: Create a .env file and add your environment variables, including your Google Maps API key and Kafka configurations.

Run migrations:

bash

python manage.py migrate

Start the Django server:

bash

python manage.py runserver

Start Kafka (ensure Kafka is running before proceeding):

bash

    # Command to start Kafka

Usage

    After setting up the project, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.
    The map will display the real-time location of the delivery boy based on the Kafka data streams.

How It Works
Kafka Integration

    Producer: Generates location data (latitude and longitude) and sends it to a Kafka topic.
    Consumer: Listens to the Kafka topic and updates the Django backend with the new location data.

Google Maps Integration

    The Django backend serves location data to the front end, which is displayed on a Google Map.
    The map updates in real time as new data is received from Kafka.
